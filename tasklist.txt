Things to modify:
Create new activies, item categories, etc.

Sorting should be able to be completed without reloading anything

Adding Characteristics should be done without loading a new page

Reviewing should be done without having to load new page. Radio button on click creates a message box for description?

have a load option for displaying reviews on the profile page

Main Issues:

1) how can i render a partial while passing in objects in ERB BEFORE JS in order to render the partial correctly (<%=@activity = Activity.new%>
2) how can i hijack the submit button in the partial immediately after adding it to the HTML.
3) then update the page with results

Index should realistically obtain a list asynchronously. That way with new creations, the list should auto update.

Probably should rewrite the imc list to be more ajax.

Probably need to separate the rating functionality from the description of the rating.

Should have the various calculated averages update more seamlessly.

Need to finish up the char list
